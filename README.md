# Lab 2: Intro to MVC with thermometer

## Objective

- Create a creative view for the server room thermometer 
- Use `pygame` to design a GUI

## Getting Started

1. Here is the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gormes-EPIC/thermometer) for the current project. Running `controller.py` will start the program. The display will show up a little strange in full screen, but you can change the fullscreen to `screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1024, 600), 0, 32)` to get the aspect ratio correct when you are designing for the tiny screens.
2. Your task is to create a function which takes two parameters, `temp`and`screen`, and displays a view using pygame.
3. When you are done you will need to be added as a collaborator on GitHub. Update `controller.py`, `view.py`, and the `README.md` appropriately. 

## Deliverables

1. Be added as a collaborator on GitHub.
2. Update `controller.py` to add your new view to the if statement that selects a new random view and update the random statement appropriately.
3. Update `view.py` to add your new function.
4. Add any necessary assets to the assets and fonts folders.
5. Update the `README.md` to add your view and your name to the credits at the bottom.
